    <h1>Explaining Pokemon Type Matchups</h1>

    <p>
        The Pokemon series originated as a series of games
        in the genre of a rpg. Within these games, you are 
        meant to build teams of up to 6 pokemon. Each pokemon
        is assigned one to two types.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the most recent installations of the Pokemon game series,
        there are a total of 18 different types, with each having its own
        strengths and weaknesses. This is where Pokemon's strategy is implemented.
        For example, if you choose a pokemon with the <b>fire</b> type, an opponent with a <b>grass</b> type
        pokemon would be at a disadvantage against you, while one with a <b>water</b> type pokemon
        may find themselves in an advantagous position.

        In total, there are more than a thousand pokemon, and the number only increases with every
        installment to the series. While it would be too much to go over them right now, a popular 
        website used to keep track of them is <a href="https://pokemondb.net/">pokemondb</a>

    <p>
        Within the games, there are also other elements of strategy implemented, for example,
        some games include <a href="transformations.html">special transformations,</a> and majority
        of the games use individual <a href="stats.html">stats,</a> on each pokemon.
