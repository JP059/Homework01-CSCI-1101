    <h1>Transformations within Pokemon</h1>
    <p>
        Within the Pokemon games there are several different types of transformation, some
        which are locked to specific Pokemon, like <b>mega evolutions</b>, and others which
        any pokemon can undergo, such as <b>dynamaxing.</b>
    </p>
    
    <h1>Mega Evolution</h1>
    <p>
        In the 6th Pokemon generation, Mega Evolutions were introduced, allowing specific pokemon
        to transform into a stronger and enhanced version of themselves when holding a specific item.
        This gives them access to higher stats, allowing them to be stronger in battle, and giving 
        someone the advantage in a battle.
    </p>


    <h1>Dynamaxing</h1>
    <p>
        Dynamaxing was introduced in the 8th generation of games. Dynamaxing allows for any pokemon
        the user chooses to grow in size to a massive scale, and gives access to much stronger moves.
        This transformation only lasts three turns of combat, and can only be used once per battle, 
        but in turn gives the pokemon access to a much larger health pool as well as hit much harder.
    </p>


    <h2>Gigantamaxing</h2>
    <p>
        Gigantamaxing is a sub category of Dynamaxing. The difference lies in the fact that Gigantamaxing
        is only accessible to specific pokemon, but gives them a new form as opposed to just growing in size
        as well as new signature moves specific to that pokemon. This makes them stronger than Dynamaxed
        pokemon, but is hindered by the same limitations.
    </p>


    <h1>Terrastalization</h1>
    <p>
        Terrastialization was introduced in the most recent 9th generation. This allows the pokemon 
        to switch the typing of the pokemon to any one assigned type. The type that it switches to 
        is assigned before the battle, but it gives access to multiple new strategies, allowing
        you to change entirely what a pokemon is weak against and strong against.
