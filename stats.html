    <h1>Pokemon Stats</h1>
    <p>
        Each pokemon has access to 6 different stats, including <b>health, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed.</b>
        health and speed are self explanatory, health determines the amount of hitpoints a pokemon 
        has, and the pokemon with the higher speed stat gets to go first in battle.
        The reason for the two different attack stats and two different defense stats
        is due to the fact that each attack move in the game is assigned as physical or special.
        Physical attacks' damage are determined by the attacking pokemon's attack stat, and the 
        defending pokemon's defense stat, while moves assigned to the special category
        work the same way with the special attack and special defense stats.
